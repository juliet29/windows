## Overview? 

- Background
- Approaches
- Conclusions 

# Background and motivation 

## Global warming in context 

- Global warming - recent reports descibe have hit 1.5ÂºC, s
- Occurence of extreme heat events is occuring more frequently, 
  - Perkins-Kirpatrick 2020, heatwave days and cumulative heat experienced  between 1950 and 2014 
- and effects of extreme heat on body, mental health, productivity
  - WHO 20xx : heat exhaustion and stroke,  increased risk of complication and death for people with chronic diseases, relatively little attention because death toll ! immediately obvious, 166k oeiple dies between 1998 - 2017  
- Ramifications felt most significantly in cities where urban heat island effect is present, # TODO source!
  - These tend to be large urban metropolises/metropoli where ubranization is occuring rapidly  
  - but also difficult for people working outside .. (not really releavant since looking at housing still -> 75% of labour force in heat-exposed work Mickensey Gloval Institute via Economist 2023)
  - also here, many people's work is outside ?
  - but still a global problem
<!-- - maybe some graph showing uhi and cities?  -->

## Mechanical cooling 
- To adapt to the heat, people to turn to mechanical sources of cooling which
  <!-- - maybe do a 2 column with pros and cons here -->
  - pros
    - relatively easy to design for 
    - industry is comfortable with 
    - reliable 
  <!-- - then strike through  -->
      - susceptible to failures during extreme heat events, 
        - Liang 2016 additional loads while power companies try to deal with stress heat places on generation, transmission and distributopn 
          - more difficult in lagre urban areas where infrastructure is strained due to rapid population growth  => blackouts and botownouts 
          - [7] and [8] here, increase in electiricity ownership in Shangai, but electriicity shortage at 1 million kWh 
      <!-- - s grid black outs during these, as well as equipment peformance charts  -->
  - cons 
    - consume a high amount of energy, s: energy consumption from residential cooling 
      - International Energy Agency, Future of Cooling report (IEA, FOC) => AC + electric fan => 20% of total energy use in buildings toda 
    - unaffordable
      - IEA FOC => ability to own AC is constrained to income, 99% private apartements in Singapore have and are running most of the time , where as 4% in India even though have comprable cooling needs + Figure 2.1 
      <!-- # TODO  more people owning ac, means more cooling energy consumption, which unless the grid is clean, means more heat events, make figure for this -> visous cycle  -->

## Natural cooling 
- Natural cooling is needed 
<!-- - now more than ever critical to explore less-energy intensive methods of cooling  -->
  - pros 
    - low operational energy 
    - accesible
    - rich history, people have relied on natural cooling methods for centuries,
      - architectural history.. recent emergence of mechanical cooling, s 
      - IEA FOC => modern AC unit invented in 1900s, began to take off in the US in the 1950s 
      <!-- - maybe a timeline here?  -->
  - cons 
    - difficult to design for 
    - industry skepticism 
    - unreliable due to uncertainty 
      - occupant behavior 
      - outdoor climate 

## Research questions 

- Work seeks to better understand and address sources of uncertainty regarding natural cooling.
- overview of modes of natural cooling 
  - Lisa Heschong, Thermal Delight in Architecture: vernacular building traditions across the world display ... sophisticated thermal adaptation, p.8
  - Zhang Table 2 
  
- Start with ventilative cooling ->  windows, have aspects of temperature and occupant uncertainty 
  - critical for mediating relationship between indoor and outdoor, but effectiveness is dependent on two uncertain factors that brought up before: occupant behavior, outdoor climate
- and also the design of the building which, once decided upon, is less uncertain 
- Questions 
  - question 1: what is the effect of opening and closing windows on indoor climate 
  - question 2: how can we enable to practitioners to access this information in a fast enough way to be useful for decision making  in the early stages of the design process 


# Approaches  

## Why understanding w/o/c is important 
- uninvasive? way of determining if windows open/closed can enable better understanding of occupant behavior 
- understanding when windows are open, enables us to use to contextural info and social methods to understand why they are open => D'Oca and Hong [97 from Dai 2020] gruped occupants into 3-types: thermal-driven, time-driven, thermal+time driven => no follow up on this but critical for designers
- critical information for designers 

## Research on window opening and closing to date 

- history of this 
  <!-- - timeline here? + model performance  -->
  
  - Dai 2020 Table 1 => popular methods + Fig 5 => frequency of ML methods used, 4.2.1 = prediction of window opening closing action 
    - fritsch, 1990 [54] Markov chain methods 
    - Haldi and Robinson [78] markov chain + logistic regression 
    - Schweiker [79] tested this (also the source of external data!) => differences in culture meant different performance 
    - Markovic [80] Bayesian and random forest 
    - de rautlin de roy, 2023, looked at different learning techniques 
- methods 
  <!-- - table that gets filled in as timeline happens  -->
  - methods of data collection: x years long sample, places where data collected, types of buildings where data collected 
  - methods of analysis + model performance?: logistic regression, machine learning models
  - gaps:  
    <!-- - add to table   -->
    - long data collection periods
    - supervised models : unclear how coefficients/models transfer to randically different buildings in different climates 


## (Maybe):
- sipervised vs unsupervised models ** TODO come back to this, highly philosophical...
  - super:
    - collect data on long period of time, test, and train optimal parameters and use for future prediction, assuming data will have some similarity
- 



## My approach:
- develop understanding of physical processes governing changes in indoor temperature through 
  - measurement and analysis 
  - energy modeling tools 
  - computational fluid dynamics 

# Measurement and time series analysis 

## Measurement procedure 
-  guided by aim to develop a model: using temperature data, is it possible to predict when win open/close? 
- room in rosse etc 
- what the data looks like 
- highlight trends => temperature in certain room changed by xyz when windows open/close 
- when had the coolest times in room / greatest differential from indoor and outdoor..

## Time series analysis
-  time series approach 


# Energy modeling tools 

## Energy model 
- model built in energy+ 
- similarities and differences from real life data 
- difference in prediction 

# CFD 

## CFD progress on this so far 
- how this works 
- progress so far 
- integrating all three...

# Conclusions 

## Comclusion 
- problems to solve
- question asked 
- approach taken to solve
- results so far 

## Future Work 
- continue work on 3 levers?
- questions aksed by CIFE people
