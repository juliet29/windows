## Overview? 

- Background
- Approaches
- Conclusions 

# Background and motivation 

## Global warming in context 

- Global warming - recent reports descibe have hit 1.5ÂºC, s
- Occurence of extreme heat events is occuring more frequently, and effects of extreme heat on body, mental health, productivity, s 
- Ramifications felt most significantly in cities where urban heat island effect is present, s 
  - These tend to be large urban metropolises/metropoli where ubranization is occuring rapidly 
  - also here, many people's work is outside ?
  - but still a global problem
<!-- - maybe some graph showing uhi and cities?  -->

## Mechanical cooling 
- To adapt to the heat, people to turn to mechanical sources of cooling which
  <!-- - maybe do a 2 column with pros and cons here -->
  - pros
    - relatively easy to design for 
    - industry is comfortable with 
    - reliable 
  <!-- - then strike through  -->
      - susceptible to failures during extreme heat events, 
      <!-- - s grid black outs during these, as well as equipment peformance charts  -->
  - cons 
    - consume a high amount of energy, s: energy consumption from residential cooling 
    - unaffordable
      - cost to own and operate an ac is this range, s
      - in cities of greatest concern incomes are rising quickly, s
      - but x% of population live in informal housing / have this income level 
      <!-- - more people owning ac, means more cooling energy consumption, but not inherently accesible  -->

## Natural cooling 
- Natural cooling is needed 
<!-- - now more than ever critical to explore less-energy intensive methods of cooling  -->
  - pros 
    - low operational energy 
    - accesible
    - rich history, people have relied on natural cooling methods for centuries,
      - architectural history.. recent emergence of mechanical cooling, s 
      <!-- - maybe a timeline here?  -->
  - cons 
    - difficult to design for 
    - industry skepticism 
    - unreliable due to uncertainty 
      - occupant behavior 
      - outdoor climate 

## Research questions 

- Work seeks to better understand and address sources of uncertainty regarding natural cooling.
- Start with low hanging fruit: windows 
- critical for mediating relationship between indoor and outdoor, but effectiveness is dependent on two uncertain factors that brought up before: occupant behavior, outdoor climate
- and also the design of the building which, once decided upon, is less uncertain 
- Questions 
  - question 1: what is the effect of opening and closing windows on indoor climate 
  - question 2: how can we enable to practitioners to access this information in a fast enough way to be useful for decision making  in the early stages of the design process 

# Approaches  

## Research on window opening and closing to date 

- history of this 
  <!-- - timeline here? + model performance  -->
  - fritsch, logistic regression, 19?
  - de rautlin de roy, 2023
- methods 
  <!-- - table that gets filled in as timeline happens  -->
  - methods of data collection: x years long sample, places where data collected, types of buildings where data collected 
  - methods of analysis + model performance?: logistic regression, machine learning models
  - gaps:  
    <!-- - add to table   -->
    - long data collection periods
    - unclear how coefficients/models transfer to randically different buildings in different climates 

## Why understanding w/o/c is important 
- uninvasive? way of determining if windows open/closed can enable better understanding of occupant behavior 
- understanding when windows are open, enables us to use to contextural info and social methods to understand why they are open
- critical information for designers 

## My approach:
- develop understanding of physical processes governing changes in indoor temperature through 
  - measurement and analysis 
  - energy modeling tools 
  - computational fluid dynamics 

# Measurement and time series analysis 

## Measurement procedure 
-  guided by aim to develop a model: using temperature data, is it possible to predict when win open/close? 
- room in rosse etc 
- what the data looks like 
- highlight trends => temperature in certain room changed by xyz when windows open/close 
- when had the coolest times in room / greatest differential from indoor and outdoor..

## Time series analysis
-  time series approach 


# Energy modeling tools 

## Energy model 
- model built in energy+ 
- similarities and differences from real life data 
- difference in prediction 

# CFD 

## CFD progress on this so far 
- how this works 
- progress so far 
- integrating all three...

# Conclusions 

## Comclusion 
- problems to solve
- question asked 
- approach taken to solve
- results so far 

## Future Work 
- continue work on 3 levers?
- questions aksed by CIFE people
