## Mechanical Cooling 
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Pros**

- Easy to design for 
- Accepted in industry 
- Enabled increased productivity 
- Reliable
:::



::: {.column width="50%" .fragment .incremental}
**Cons** 

- Susceptible to failure during heat waves 

  ::: {.small-bullet}
  - Loads increase when power system most vulnerable, leading to blackouts 
  - In Shanghai, documented shortages greater than a 1 GWh ^[@liangHeatWaveElectricity2016]
  :::

- Energy intensive 

  ::: {.small-bullet}
  - AC + electric fan account for 20% of total energy use in buildings ^[@ieaFutureCoolingOpportunities2018]
  :::

- Inaccesible 

  ::: {.small-bullet}
  - Ability to own an AC constrained by income ^[@ieaFutureCoolingOpportunities2018]
    - 99% of private apartments in Singapore have AC
    - Closer to 4% of households in India

## Natural Cooling 
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Pros**

- Low operational energy 
- Accessible 
- Has worked well for some time 

  ::: {.small-bullet}
  - Modern AC unit invented in 1900 and only became popular in the US in the 1950s ^[@ieaFutureCoolingOpportunities2018]
  :::
:::

::: {.column width="50%" .fragment}
**Cons**

- Difficult to design for 
- Industry skepticism 
- Unreliable due to uncertainty 
  - Occupant behavior 
  - Outdoor climate

  - What is the effect of window opening and closing on **indoor climate**?
  - How does this change with different **building designs**, **occupant behavior**, and **outdoor climate**?
  - How can **practitioners access** and **leverage** this information in the **early** stages of the design process?

## Why Predicting W/O/C is Useful

::: {.incremental}
- Less invasive way of determining occupant actions

- Understanding **when** windows are open, enables us to use to contextual information understand **why** they are open

  :::{.small-bullet}
  - D'Oca and Hong grouped occupants into 3-types: thermal-driven, time-driven, thermal+time driven ^[@docaDataminingApproachDiscover2014]

    title History of Social Media Platform
    1990 : Fritsch : Markov chain models 
    1990 : Haldi and Robinson : Markov chain and logistic regression 
    1990 : Schweiker : Tests reveal performance affected by cultural changes
    1990 : Markovic : Bayesian and random forest regression 
    2023 : de Rautlin de Roy : review of machine learning performance and new metrics

<!-- TODO timeline   -->
  <!-- - Dai 2020 Table 1 => popular methods + Fig 5 => frequency of ML methods used, 4.2.1 = prediction of window opening closing action 
    - fritsch, 1990 [54] Markov chain methods 
    - Haldi and Robinson [78] markov chain + logistic regression 
    - Schweiker [79] tested this (also the source of external data!) => differences in culture meant different performance 
    - Markovic [80] Bayesian and random forest 
    - de rautlin de roy, 2023, looked at different learning techniques  -->

## Research Gaps 
<!-- TODO table with author, length of data collected, location, method, and supervised/not    -->
  - gaps:  
    - long data collection periods: shorter periods are needed for practical use
    - only supervised models : unclear how coefficients/models transfer to radically different buildings in different climates



<!-- discussion of supervised vs not. -->
