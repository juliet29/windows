## Mechanical Cooling 
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Pros**

- Easy to design for 
- Accepted in industry 
- Enabled increased productivity 
- Reliable
:::



::: {.column width="50%" .fragment .incremental}
**Cons** 

- Susceptible to failure during heat waves 

  ::: {.small-bullet}
  - Loads increase when power system most vulnerable, leading to blackouts 
  - In Shanghai, documented shortages greater than a 1 GWh ^[@liangHeatWaveElectricity2016]
  :::

- Energy intensive 

  ::: {.small-bullet}
  - AC + electric fan account for 20% of total energy use in buildings ^[@ieaFutureCoolingOpportunities2018]
  :::

- Inaccesible 

  ::: {.small-bullet}
  - Ability to own an AC constrained by income ^[@ieaFutureCoolingOpportunities2018]
    - 99% of private apartments in Singapore have AC
    - Closer to 4% of households in India

## Natural Cooling 
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Pros**

- Low operational energy 
- Accessible 
- Has worked well for some time 

  ::: {.small-bullet}
  - Modern AC unit invented in 1900 and only became popular in the US in the 1950s ^[@ieaFutureCoolingOpportunities2018]

::: {.column width="50%" .fragment}
**Cons**

- Difficult to design for 
- Industry skepticism 
- Unreliable due to uncertainty 
  - Occupant behavior 
  - Outdoor climate

  - What is the effect of window opening and closing on **indoor climate**?
  - How does this change with different **building designs**, **occupant behavior**, and **outdoor climate**?
  - How can **practitioners access** and **leverage** this information in the **early** stages of the design process?

## Why Predicting W/O/C is Useful

::: {.incremental}
- Less invasive way of determining occupant actions

- Understanding **when** windows are open, enables us to use to contextual information understand **why** they are open

  :::{.small-bullet}
  - D'Oca and Hong grouped occupants into 3-types: thermal-driven, time-driven, thermal+time driven ^[@docaDataminingApproachDiscover2014]

**Previous work**

- Fritsch (1990) Markov chain models 
- Haldi and Robinson (2009) Markov chain and logistic regression 
- Schweiker (2010) Tests reveal performance affected by cultural changes
- Markovic (2017) Bayesian and random forest regression

**Gaps**

- No data collection periods ~ days
- No discussion of unsupervised models
