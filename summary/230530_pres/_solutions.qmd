<!-- ## Mechanical Cooling 
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
- Pros
::: {.incremental}
  - Easy to design for 
  - Accepted in industry 
  - Enabled increased productivity 
  - Reliable?
::: {.incremental}
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
- Cons 
  ::: {.incremental}
  - Susceptible to failure during heat waves 
    - Loads increase when power system most vulnerable, leading to blackouts
    - In Shanghai, documented shortages greater than a 1 GWh ^[@liangHeatWaveElectricity2016]
  - Energy intensive 
    - AC + electric fan account for 20% of total energy use in buildings ^[@internationalenergyagencyFutureCoolingOpportunities2018]
  - Inaccesible 
    - Ability to own an AC constrained by income ^[@internationalenergyagencyFutureCoolingOpportunities2018]
      - 99% of private apartments in Singapore have AC
      - Closer to 4% of households in India

## Natural Cooling 
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
- Pros
  - Low operational energy 
  - Accessible 
  - Has worked well for some time 
    - modern AC unit invented in 1900s, first popularized in the US in the 1950s ^[@internationalenergyagencyFutureCoolingOpportunities2018]
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
- Cons 
    - Difficult to design for 
    - Industry skepticism 
    - Unreliable due to uncertainty 
      - Occupant behavior 
      - Outdoor climate

## Why Windows?
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
- Both climate and occupant uncertainty

:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
- Questions 
    - what is the effect of opening and closing windows on indoor climate?
    - how can we enable to practitioners to access this information in a fast enough way to be useful for decision making  in the early stages of the design process

::::

## why predicting w/o/c is important 
- uninvasive way of determining if windows open/closed 
- can enable better understanding of occupant behavior 
- understanding when windows are open, enables us to use to contextual information understand why they are open
  - D'Oca and Hong grouped occupants into 3-types: thermal-driven, time-driven, thermal+time driven ^[@docaDataminingApproachDiscover2014]
- critical information for designers 

## predicting w/o/c since 1990...
<!-- TODO timeline   -->
  - Dai 2020 Table 1 => popular methods + Fig 5 => frequency of ML methods used, 4.2.1 = prediction of window opening closing action 
    - fritsch, 1990 [54] Markov chain methods 
    - Haldi and Robinson [78] markov chain + logistic regression 
    - Schweiker [79] tested this (also the source of external data!) => differences in culture meant different performance 
    - Markovic [80] Bayesian and random forest 
    - de rautlin de roy, 2023, looked at different learning techniques

## research gaps 
<!-- TODO table with author, length of data collected, location, method, and supervised/not    -->
  - gaps:  
    - long data collection periods: shorter periods are needed for practical use
    - only supervised models : unclear how coefficients/models transfer to radically different buildings in different climates
