# Analysis

## Approach

:::: {.columns }

::: {.column width="40%" }

:::{.styled-side .styled-side-high}
*Design an unsupervised method to predict window/open closing based on short periods of easily accesible data*
:::


:::

::: {.column width="40%" .incremental .fragment .right-col-space}
**Tools**

  - Measurment
  - Time series analysis 
  - Building energy modeling 
  - Computational fluid dynamics

## Measurement Technique
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
![Sensor Placement](figures/data_collection/sensor_placement.png){fig-align="left" width=6in height=4in}

![](figures/data_collection/data_logger.png){.absolute top=442px left=350px width=2in}

:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
- Data collected in adjacent rooms
- Experimented with different window treatments 
- Affordable sensors 
:::

::::

::: {.notes}
highlight that sensors used are affordable, and many modern buildings already monitor temperature as part of their operation

:::

<!-- TODO: some inights about how much WOC helped over all -->

::: {.notes}
highlight that predicting the window opening close data as a function of temperature 
and that didnt colelct for very long periods of time

## Predicting W/O/C at a High Level 
<!-- TODO: figure for all of these -->


::: {layout-nrow=2 }


![Observe](figures/predicting_at_high_level/observed.png){height="3in" width="3in"}

::: {.fragment}
![Smooth](figures/predicting_at_high_level/smoothed.png){height="3in" width="3in"}
:::

::: {.fragment}
![Difference](figures/predicting_at_high_level/differenced.png){height="3in" width="3in"}
:::

::: {.fragment}
![Differentiate](figures/predicting_at_high_level/derivative.png){height="3in" width="3in"}

<!-- 1. have observed time series, here indoor temperature 
1. smooth out some way 
2. make anomalies due to w/oc uniquely apparent
   - subtracting smoothed data and 
   - taking derivatives
3. detect anaomalies using *likelihood estimation* -->
<!-- TODO: not sure if this is actually likelihood estimation?? -->

::: {.notes}
note that any combo of 2 and 3 could work...

## smoothing using stl 
- how stl works  

## essentially, trying to seperate signal from noise 
<!-- TODO: figure for all of these + show decompositions of the data -->
- indoor temp, constant distortion from outside due to building materials
- seasonality from day to night transition 
- + noise from people doing stuff inside 
- + w/o/c
