# Recap 


## Reflections 
- Need better understanding the unique way that W/O/C appears in the time series
  - How this differs 
    - Based on time of day 
    - Length of w/o/c
  -  BEM + CFD for this?
- What sort of smoothing method is truly best for this use case?
- Test on larger external data set
