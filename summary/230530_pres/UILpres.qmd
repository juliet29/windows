# Global warming in context 

## untitled
<!-- TODO image of global warming  -->
::: {.notes}
Project is situated in the context of a warming world 
:::


## untitled
<!-- TODO nature figure, double pane  -->
- XX% increase in cumulative heat intensity between 1950 and 2014 


::: aside

:::

::: {.notes}
XX places recieving as many as XX additional hours of intense heat each year..
:::

## untitled
- heat exhaustion 
- stroke 
- increased risks for those with pre-existing conditions
- 166,000 excess deaths between 1998 - 2017


::: aside
@worldhealthorganizationHeatwaves
:::

::: {.notes}
although heat waves do not get as much attention as other natural disasters because there impacts are not immediately obvious, they do have significant impacts on human health 
:::

## vulnerable regions
- urban heat island effect increases the intensity of heat waves  ^[@source]?
- emerging markets have higher % of people working outside, increasing exposure
  - in India, 75% of people are in "heat-exposed professions" ^[@IndiaDeadlyHeatwaves]


# Solutions? 

## mechanical cooling 
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
- Pros
  - easy to design for 
  - accepted in industry 
  - has supported development in warmer parts of the world
  - reliable?
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
- Cons 
  - susceptible to failure during heat waves 
    - loads increase when power system most vulnerable, leading to blackouts
    - in Shanghai, documented shortages greater than a 1 GWh ^[@liangHeatWaveElectricity2016]
  - energy intensive 
    - AC + electric fan account for 20% of total energy use in buildings ^[@internationalenergyagencyFutureCoolingOpportunities2018]
  - inaccesible 
    - ability to own an AC constrained by income ^[@internationalenergyagencyFutureCoolingOpportunities2018]
      - 99% of private apartments in Singapore have AC
      - Closer to 4% of households in India 
    <!-- TODO figure of from IEA if desired and fits..  -->

<!-- TODO figure of visous cycle  -->


## natural cooling 
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

  - low operational energy 
  - accessible 
  - has worked well for some time 
    - modern AC unit invented in 1900s, first popularized in the US in the 1950s ^[@internationalenergyagencyFutureCoolingOpportunities2018]

- Cons 
    - difficult to design for 
    - industry skepticism 
    - unreliable due to uncertainty 
      - occupant behavior 
      - outdoor climate

## why windows?
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
- Both climate and occupant uncertainty

:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
- Questions 
    - what is the effect of opening and closing windows on indoor climate?
    - how can we enable to practitioners to access this information in a fast enough way to be useful for decision making  in the early stages of the design process 

:::

::::

## why predicting w/o/c is important 
- uninvasive way of determining if windows open/closed 
- can enable better understanding of occupant behavior 
- understanding when windows are open, enables us to use to contextual information understand why they are open
  - D'Oca and Hong grouped occupants into 3-types: thermal-driven, time-driven, thermal+time driven ^[@docaDataminingApproachDiscover2014]
- critical information for designers 

## predicting w/o/c since 1990...
<!-- TODO timeline   -->
  - Dai 2020 Table 1 => popular methods + Fig 5 => frequency of ML methods used, 4.2.1 = prediction of window opening closing action 
    - fritsch, 1990 [54] Markov chain methods 
    - Haldi and Robinson [78] markov chain + logistic regression 
    - Schweiker [79] tested this (also the source of external data!) => differences in culture meant different performance 
    - Markovic [80] Bayesian and random forest 
    - de rautlin de roy, 2023, looked at different learning techniques

## research gaps 
<!-- TODO table with author, length of data collected, location, method, and supervised/not    -->
  - gaps:  
    - long data collection periods: shorter periods are needed for practical use
    - only supervised models : unclear how coefficients/models transfer to radically different buildings in different climates


::: aside
discussion of supervised vs not.
:::


## approach
- problem statement: design an unsupervised method to predict window/open closing based on short periods of easily accesible data 
<!-- TODO: wite a problem statement that involves the question -->
<!-- TODO: instead of just listing tools, give a preview of what going to discuss -->
- tools
  - measurment
  - time series analysis 
  - building energy modeling 
  - computational fluid dynamics 


# Analysis

## measurement technique
<!-- TODO: fix alignment of sensor  -->


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- Data collected in adjacent rooms
- Affordable sensors 
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
::: {layout-nrow=2}
![Sensor Placement](figures/data_collection/sensor_placement.png){fig-align="left"}

![Data Logger](figures/data_collection/data_logger.png){fig-align="left" height=70}
:::
:::

::::

::: {.notes}
highlight that sensors used are affordable, and many modern buildings already monitor temperature as part of their operation 
:::

## collected data  
![](figures/data_collection/data_collected.png){height=500}
<!-- TODO: some inights about how much WOC helped over all -->

::: {.notes}
highlight that predicting the window opening close data as a function of temperature 
and that didnt colelct for very long periods of time 
:::


## predicting w/o/c at a high level 
<!-- TODO: figure for all of these -->
::: {layout-nrow=2}
![Observed](figures/predicting_at_high_level/observed.png){height=20}

![Smoothed](figures/predicting_at_high_level/smoothed.png){height=20}

![Difference](figures/predicting_at_high_level/differenced.png){height=20}

![Derivative](figures/predicting_at_high_level/derivative.png){height=250}
:::
1. have observed time series, here indoor temperature 
2. smooth out some way 
3. make anomalies due to w/oc uniquely apparent
   - subtracting smoothed data and 
   - taking derivatives
4. detect anaomalies using *likelihood estimation*
<!-- TODO: not sure if this is actually likelihood estimation?? -->

::: {.notes}
note that any combo of 2 and 3 could work... 
:::

## essentially, trying to seperate signal from noise 
<!-- TODO: figure for all of these -->
- indoor temp, constant distortion from outside due to building materials
- seasonality from day to night transition 
- + noise from people doing stuff inside 
- + w/o/c

## 1. observed time series using building energy modeling...
<!-- - can recreate real life scenario and simplify so don't have noise  -->
<!-- TODO: add text, reorganize so that building in own column... -->

## back to reality -> 1. observed data 
<!-- TODO: real vs observed data   -->

## STL results 
<!-- TODO: STL figure-->

## other smoothing techniques 
<!-- TODO: othe rsmoothing technique figures -->


## results 
<!-- TODO: de raultin de roy metrics + compare to other ML methods on same data  -->

## next steps..
- better understanding the unique way that w/o/c appears in the time series
  - how this differs 
    - based on time of day 
    - length of w/o/c
  - can use BEM + CFD for this?
- when sort of smoothing method is truly best for this use case?
- test on larger external data set
