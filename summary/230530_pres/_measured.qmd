# Analysis: Measurements 

## back to reality -> 1. observed data 
<!-- TODO: real vs observed data   -->

## STL results 
<!-- TODO: STL figure-->

## other smoothing techniques 
<!-- TODO: othe rsmoothing technique figures -->


## results 
<!-- TODO: de raultin de roy metrics + compare to other ML methods on same data  -->


## reflections 
- better understanding the unique way that w/o/c appears in the time series
  - how this differs 
    - based on time of day 
    - length of w/o/c
  - can use BEM + CFD for this?
- when sort of smoothing method is truly best for this use case?
- test on larger external data set
