Building energy models suffer from limited accuracy due to dependence on simplistic schedules for describing occupant behavior. This inaccuracy is especially pertinent when simulating naturally cooled buildings which rely on wind and buoyancy, specifically heat transfer with the ambient, for cooling. Simplistic schedules for window opening and closing can lead to errors in determining the volume and thermophysical characteristics of outside air allowed into a building, leading to flawed designs of naturally cooled buildings and poor predictions of operational energy consumption. In this paper, we propose a methodology for a building-specific model of window operation that combines time series measurements of indoor/outdoor air properties. Our proposed model utilizes only readily available temperature and relative humidity data to make binary classifications of if a window is open or closed. Preliminary results from a case study of a multi-family residential building on Stanfordâ€™s campus indicates that our proposed method can successfully classify window open/closures with minimal training and building specific information. Overall, this work aims to enable more accurate modeling of naturally cooled buildings and further catalyze widespread adoption of this low-carbon technology.
